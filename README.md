# macOS Lockdown (mOSL)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/0xmachos/mOSL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/0xmachos/mOSL) [![GitHub Release](https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/release/0xmachos/mOSL.svg)](https://github.com/0xmachos/mOSL/releases/latest)

Bash script to audit and fix macOS Catalina (`10.15.x`) security settings

Inspired by and based on [Lockdown](https://objective-see.com/products/lockdown.html) by [Patrick Wardle](https://twitter.com/patrickwardle) and [osxlockdown](https://github.com/SummitRoute/osxlockdown) by [Scott Piper](https://twitter.com/0xdabbad00https://twitter.com/0xdabbad00). 

## Warnings

**mOSL is being rewritten in Swift and the Bash version will be deprecated.**. See: "[The Future of mOSL](https://0xmachos.github.io/2019-09-21-The-Future-of-mOSL/)".

- **Always** run the [latest release](https://github.com/0xmachos/mOSL/releases/latest) **not** the code in `master`!
- This script will **only ever** support the _latest_ macOS release  
- This script requires your **password** to invoke some commands with `sudo`  


## `brew`

tap: [`0xmachos/homebrew-mosl`](https://github.com/0xmachos/homebrew-mosl)

To install mOSL via `brew` execute:

```
brew tap 0xmachos/homebrew-mosl
brew install mosl
```

mOSL will then be available as: 

```
Lockdown
```

## Threat Model(ish) 

The main goal is to enforce already secure defaults and apply more strict non-default options. 

It aims to reduce attack surface but it is pragmatic in this pursuit. The author utilises Bluetooth for services such as Handoff so it is left enabled.

There is **no specific focus** on enhancing privacy. 

Finally, mOSL will not protect you from the [FSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service), [MSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_State_Security_(China)), [DGSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate-General_for_External_Security), or [FSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster).

## `Full Disk Access` Permission

In macOS Mojave and later certain application data is protected by the OS. For example, if `Example.app` wishes to access `Contacts.app` data `Example.app` must be given explicit permission via `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy`. However some application data cannot be accessed via a specific permission. Access to this data requires the `Full Disk Access` permission. 

mOSL requires that `Terminal.app` be given the `Full Disk Access` permission. It needs this permission to audit/fix the following settings: 

- `disable mail remote content`
- `disable_auto_open_safe_downloads`

These are *currently* the **only** settings which require `Full Disk Access`.

It is not possible to programatically get or prompt for this permission, it must be manually given by the user.

To give `Terminal.app` `Full Disk Access`:

```
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access > Add Terminal.app
```

Once you are done with mOSL you can revoke `Full Disk Access` for `Terminal.app`. There's a small checkbox next to `Terminal` which you can uncheck to revoke the premssion without entirely removing `Terminal.app` from the list.

## Verification

The executable `Lockdown` file can be verified with [Minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/):
```
minisign -Vm Lockdown -P RWTiYbJbLl7q6uQ70l1XCvGExizUgEBNDPH0m/1yMimcsfgh542+RDPU
```
Install via [brew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install minisign`

## Usage

```
$ ./Lockdown 

  Audit or Fix macOS security settingsüîíüçé

  Usage: ./Lockdown [list | audit {setting_index} | fix {setting_index} | debug]

    list         - List settings that can be audited/ fixed
    audit        - Audit the status of all or chosen setting(s) (Does NOT change settings)
    fix          - Attempt to fix all or chosen setting(s) (Does change settings)

    fix-force    - Same as 'fix' however bypasses user confirmation prompt
                   (Can be used to invoke Lockdown from other scripts)

    debug        - Print debug info for troubleshooting

```
